# BuffaloOpenData-Analysis
Optional University Project

Using a Python script we collect data from OpenData Buffalo website and process only necessary data to create charts for
* Total quantities of recyclable items per year
* Overall presentation of recyclable items and their corresponding quantities
* Presentation of the 5 months with the largest amount of recyclable items, regardless of year and type of recyclable items

Finaly, we store these data in MySQL tables.
